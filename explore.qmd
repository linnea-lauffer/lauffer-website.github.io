I have visited 8 out of the 9 national parks in California.

## Redwood National and State Parks

One of my favorite national parks! The redwoods, misty trails, rivers, and even just driving on the roads in the forest can't be beat.

## Lassen Volcanic National Park

I took a solo day trip to Lassen and completed a wonderful hike that I finished just in time to beat a thunderstorm.

## Yosemite National Park

A yearly tradition. I keep coming back to Yosemite for all that it has to offer. Sometimes I bring my dogs and stick to the paved trails, and it is always worth it.

## Kings Canyon National Park

I visited in the winter, and did an early morning hike that had gorgeous views of fog rolling in below.

## Sequoia National Park

I had a fun little snow hike with one of my friends. We were amazed at how gorgeous the tall sequoias were in the snow.

## Pinnacles National Park

Exploring the caves was a blast, and I was lucky enough to spot California condors soaring overhead.

## Channel Islands National Park

I saw a lot of Channel Island foxes! I would love to go back and camp there eventually.

## Joshua Tree National Park

Every year I have attended UCSB, my friends and I have taken a trip to Joshua Tree. I have camped under the stars, and it is one of my favorite places to rock climb and hike.

*Still on the list: Death Valley National Park!*
