    "text": "Glacial Retreat in the Chugach Range, Alaska (1986-2010)\nThis project analyzed the retreat of four glaciers using Landsat satellite imagery from 1986, 2002, and 2010. The focus was on two tidewater glaciers (Columbia and Shoup), and two land-terminating glaciers (Matanuska and Nelchina). The analysis revealed that tidewater glaciers retreat more rapidly, likely due to their direct interaction with ocean water, while land-terminating glaciers are more influenced by atmospheric factors.\n\nMethods\nThis project analyzed glacial retreat in the Chugach Range, Alaska, from 1986 to 2010 using Landsat imagea for four glaciers, two tidewater and two land-terminating. Glacial extents were manually digitized as polygons in QGIS for each time point. Geoprocessing tools identified areas of ice loss and gain, which were ten visualized spatially and quantified.\nThe analysis used the WGS 84 / UTM Zone 6N projection to ensure accurate area measurements. While clear retreat patterns emerged, manual digitizing and the limitations of satellite imagery (capturing only surface area) introduce some uncertainty.\n\n\nMap of Glacial Retreat\n\n\n\nSatellite Image Comparison"
