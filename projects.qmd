## Visualizing Sleep Patterns Based on Work Nights

This project investigates how total sleep hours vary between work nights and non-work nights. Since I work a job that has primarily overnight shifts, I wanted to explore how my sleep patterns differ on nights I work compared to my days off. The data was cleaned and visualized using 'ggplot2' in R to compare average sleep duration and their distributions.

### Code and Plot

```{r}
#| message: false # use this to make sure messages don't show up
#| warning: false # use this to make sure warnings don't show up

# Read in Packages
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

# Read in and store data as an object
my_data <- read_csv("data/PersonalData.csv")

# Clean data
my_data_clean <- my_data |> 
  clean_names()

# Create a boxplot comparing total sleep by work night
ggplot(data = my_data_clean, # starting data frame
       aes(x = work_night, # x-axis: categorical predictor variable
       y = total_sleep_hours)) + # y-axis: continuous response variable 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs( x = "Work Night", y = "Total Sleep (hours)") + # relabel x and y axis
  theme_minimal() # apply a clean minimalistic theme

## Glacial Retreat in the Chugach Range, Alaska (1986-2010)

This project analyzed the retreat of four glaciers using Landsat satellite imagery from 1986, 2002, and 2010. The focus was on two tidewater glaciers (Columbia and Shoup), and two land-terminating glaciers (Matanuska and Nelchina). The analysis revealed that tidewater glaciers retreat more rapidly, likely due to their direct interaction with ocean water, while land-terminating glaciers are more influenced by atmospheric factors.

### Methods

This project analyzed glacial retreat in the Chugach Range, Alaska, from 1986 to 2010 using Landsat imagea for four glaciers, two tidewater and two land-terminating. Glacial extents were manually digitized as polygons in QGIS for each time point. Geoprocessing tools identified areas of ice loss and gain, which were ten visualized spatially and quantified.

The analysis used the WGS 84 / UTM Zone 6N projection to ensure accurate area measurements. While clear retreat patterns emerged, manual digitizing and the limitations of satellite imagery (capturing only surface area) introduce some uncertainty.

### Interpretation

As shown above, glacial coverage has notably decreased. This comparison of 1986 and 2010 satellite imagery from the Chugach Range is consistent with the findings that tidewater glaciers respond more rapidly to climate change.
