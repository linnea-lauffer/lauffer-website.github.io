I love my pets. I have one cat named Tioga, and two lovable Bernese Mountain Dogs, Roxy and Honor.

I love spending time outdoors, and try to get out camping whenever I can. Roxy has even joined me on a backpacking trip, and both dogs are always up for a camping adventure.

I have always been drawn to the water, whether it is the ocean, a lake, or a river. My friend joke that I am basically a fish and honestly, they are not wrong.
